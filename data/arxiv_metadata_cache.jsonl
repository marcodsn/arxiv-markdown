The observed data are found to agree with Standard Model\npredictions and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the coupling of a\nhypothetical new spin-1 $Z'$ resonance with Standard Model quarks as a function\nof the assumed $Z'$-boson mass in the range between 20 and 200 GeV."}

This makes it desirable to find analogues of\nthis paradox in simple and experimentally accessible systems, whose resolutions\nmay shed light on this longstanding and fundamental problem. Here, we review\nand resolve the apparent \"information paradox\" in two different interfaces\nseparating Abelian and non-Abelian quantum Hall states. In both cases, the\ninformation carried by the pseudospin degree of freedom of the Abelian anyons\nget scrambled when they cross the interface and enter the non-Abelian quantum\nHall liquid.

For some hosts, this changes the identification\nof the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean\ndifference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1\nsigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB\nand Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are\ntoo small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of\n42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic\ncrosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder."}

The allowed configurations\nare divided into two branches: The first one essentially corresponds to an\nextension of the solutions already known for the standard Noetherian conformal\ntheory. The second branch is only possible due to the non-Noetherian conformal\ncontribution of the action. The complete characterization of this branch is\nexpressed by a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. We have\nfound the general solution of this equation using both seemingly new and\nwell-established mathematical tools."}

Subsequently, we further delve\ninto prevalent feature extraction strategies employed in text-based person\nRe-ID research, followed by a concise summary of common network architectures\nwithin the domain. Prevalent loss functions utilized for model optimization and\nmodality alignment in text-based person Re-ID are also scrutinized. To\nconclude, we offer a concise summary of our findings, pinpointing challenges in\ntext-based person Re-ID. In response to these challenges, we outline potential\navenues for future open-set text-based person Re-ID and present a baseline\narchitecture for text-based pedestrian image generation-guided\nre-identification(TBPGR)."}

Recently, some scene text segmentation methods have made\nsignificant progress in segmenting regular text. However, these methods perform\npoorly in scenarios containing artistic text. Therefore, this paper focuses on\nthe more challenging task of artistic text segmentation and constructs a real\nartistic text segmentation dataset. One challenge of the task is that the local\nstroke shapes of artistic text are changeable with diversity and complexity. We\npropose a decoder with the layer-wise momentum query to prevent the model from\nignoring stroke regions of special shapes. Another challenge is the complexity\nof the global topological structure. We further design a skeleton-assisted head\nto guide the model to focus on the global structure.

Recently, some scene text segmentation methods have made\nsignificant progress in segmenting regular text. However, these methods perform\npoorly in scenarios containing artistic text. Therefore, this paper focuses on\nthe more challenging task of artistic text segmentation and constructs a real\nartistic text segmentation dataset. One challenge of the task is that the local\nstroke shapes of artistic text are changeable with diversity and complexity. We\npropose a decoder with the layer-wise momentum query to prevent the model from\nignoring stroke regions of special shapes. Another challenge is the complexity\nof the global topological structure. We further design a skeleton-assisted head\nto guide the model to focus on the global structure.

These findings motivated us to search for subgroups among the\nobjects examined in our previous work, which employed fractal statistics. The\npresent study considers seven open clusters that exhibit significant dispersion\nin age and/or proper motion distributions, suggesting that they would not be\nsingle clusters. For characterizing the stellar groups, we calculate the\nmembership probability using Bayesian multi-dimensional analysis by fitting the\nobserved proper motion distribution of the candidates. A probability\ndistribution is also used to determine the distance of the cluster, which is\nobtained from the mean value of the distance modes. The photometry from Gaia\nDR3 is compared with evolutionary models to estimate the cluster age and total\nmass. In our sample, double components are found only for Markarian 38 and NGC\n2659.

The\npresent study considers seven open clusters that exhibit significant dispersion\nin age and/or proper motion distributions, suggesting that they would not be\nsingle clusters. For characterizing the stellar groups, we calculate the\nmembership probability using Bayesian multi-dimensional analysis by fitting the\nobserved proper motion distribution of the candidates. A probability\ndistribution is also used to determine the distance of the cluster, which is\nobtained from the mean value of the distance modes. The photometry from Gaia\nDR3 is compared with evolutionary models to estimate the cluster age and total\nmass. In our sample, double components are found only for Markarian 38 and NGC\n2659.

In a quantum network, photons\ninteract with matter qubits at different nodes, flexibly enabling the creation\nof remote entanglement between them. Multipartite entanglement among multiple\nnodes will be crucial for many proposed quantum network applications, including\nquantum computational tasks and quantum metrology. To date, experimental\nefforts have primarily focused on generating bipartite entanglement between\nnodes, which is widely regarded as the fundamental quantum resource for quantum\nnetworks. However, relying exclusively on bipartite entanglement to form more\ncomplex multipartite entanglement introduces several challenges. These include\nthe need for ancillary qubits, extensive local entangling operations which\nincreases the preparation latency, and increasingly stringent requirements on\ncoherence times as the number of nodes grows. Here, we analyse various schemes\nthat achieve multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single step,\nbypassing the need for multiple rounds of bipartite entanglement.

In a quantum network, photons\ninteract with matter qubits at different nodes, flexibly enabling the creation\nof remote entanglement between them. Multipartite entanglement among multiple\nnodes will be crucial for many proposed quantum network applications, including\nquantum computational tasks and quantum metrology. To date, experimental\nefforts have primarily focused on generating bipartite entanglement between\nnodes, which is widely regarded as the fundamental quantum resource for quantum\nnetworks. However, relying exclusively on bipartite entanglement to form more\ncomplex multipartite entanglement introduces several challenges. These include\nthe need for ancillary qubits, extensive local entangling operations which\nincreases the preparation latency, and increasingly stringent requirements on\ncoherence times as the number of nodes grows. Here, we analyse various schemes\nthat achieve multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single step,\nbypassing the need for multiple rounds of bipartite entanglement. We\ndemonstrate that different schemes can produce distinct multipartite entangled\nstates, with varying fidelity and generation rates.

Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects\nwhen humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming\nresearch is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding\nmultidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer\ninteraction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social\nscience, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming\nresearch are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single\ntask, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent\nAI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming\nresearch in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from\nmultiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement.\nIt includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with\nexpandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive\nneuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal\nrecording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time\nhuman-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms\nand well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject\nstudies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark."}

I present Penzai, a neural network\nlibrary designed to simplify model manipulation by representing models as\nsimple data structures, and Treescope, an interactive pretty-printer and array\nvisualizer that can visualize both model inputs/outputs and the models\nthemselves. Penzai models are built using declarative combinators that expose\nthe model forward pass in the structure of the model object itself, and use\nnamed axes to ensure each operation is semantically meaningful. With Penzai's\ntree-editing selector system, users can both insert and replace model\ncomponents, allowing them to intervene on intermediate values or make other\nedits to the model structure. Users can then get immediate feedback by\nvisualizing the modified model with Treescope.

This approach is universal and can be applied to any spatially\nresolved data including both experimental imaging studies and simulations, and\ncan be particularly useful for exploration of phenomena such as turbulence,\nscale-invariant transformation fronts, etc."}

ZKPs have\nunique advantages in terms of universality and minimal security assumptions\nwhen compared to other privacy-sensitive computational methods for distributed\nsystems, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation.\nTheir application spans multiple domains, from enhancing privacy in blockchain\nto facilitating confidential verification of computational tasks. This survey\nstarts with a high-level overview of the technical workings of ZKPs with a\nfocus on an increasingly relevant subset of ZKPs called zk-SNARKS. While there\nhave been prior surveys on the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ZKPs, our\nwork is distinguished by providing a broader view of practical aspects and\ndescribing many recently-developed use cases of ZKPs across various domains.\nThese application domains span blockchain privacy, scaling, storage, and\ninteroperability, as well as non-blockchain applications like voting,\nauthentication, timelocks, and machine learning.

Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity,\nowing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of\nthe aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper\nproposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called\nFLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for\nself-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence."}

The\noptimized nanostructured is then exploited in the {\\alpha}-Fe2O3/CuxO p-n\njunction, achieving an outstanding unbiased photocurrent density of 0.46\nmA/cm2, solar-to-chemical (STC) efficiency over 0.35% and a stable\nphotocharge-discharge cycling. The average solar-to-output energy efficiency\n(SOEE) for this unassisted {\\alpha}-Fe2O3-based SRFB system reaches 0.18%,\ncomparable to previously reported DSSC-assisted hematite SRFBs. The use of\nearth-abundant materials and the compatibility with scalable nanostructuring\nand heterojunction preparation techniques, offer promising opportunities for\ncost-effective device deployment in real-world applications."}

Benchmarked against various existing SNN\nlibraries/implementations, our method achieved accelerations ranging from\n$5\\times$ to $40\\times$ on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Publicly available experimental\ncodes can be found at https://github.com/EMI-Group/snn-temporal-fusion."}

Therefore, this paper proposes the use of\nsemantics-based evaluators for assessing unconstrained open-ended responses on\nVQA datasets. As characteristics of VQA have made such evaluation significantly\ndifferent than the traditional Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, to\nsystematically analyze the behaviour and compare the performance of various\nevaluators including LLM-based ones, we proposes three key properties, i.e.,\nAlignment, Consistency and Generalization, and a corresponding dataset\nAssessing VQA Evaluators (AVE) to facilitate analysis. In addition, this paper\nproposes a Semantically Flexible VQA Evaluator (SFVE) with meticulous design\nbased on the unique features of VQA evaluation.

Although Visual Question Answering (VQA) could serve as a developed\ntest field, limitations of VQA evaluation, like the inflexible pattern of Exact\nMatch, have hindered MLLMs from demonstrating their real capability and\ndiscourage rich responses. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of\nsemantics-based evaluators for assessing unconstrained open-ended responses on\nVQA datasets. As characteristics of VQA have made such evaluation significantly\ndifferent than the traditional Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, to\nsystematically analyze the behaviour and compare the performance of various\nevaluators including LLM-based ones, we proposes three key properties, i.e.,\nAlignment, Consistency and Generalization, and a corresponding dataset\nAssessing VQA Evaluators (AVE) to facilitate analysis. In addition, this paper\nproposes a Semantically Flexible VQA Evaluator (SFVE) with meticulous design\nbased on the unique features of VQA evaluation. Experimental results verify the\nfeasibility of model-based VQA evaluation and effectiveness of the proposed\nevaluator that surpasses existing semantic evaluators by a large margin.

However, searching such an index has\nresulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and\ninefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation\nof filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which\ninvolves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by\nmodern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which\ndemonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a\nNAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than\ncomplete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing\nexisting circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching.

However, searching such an index has\nresulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and\ninefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation\nof filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which\ninvolves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by\nmodern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which\ndemonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a\nNAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than\ncomplete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing\nexisting circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching.

The present paper covers recent proposed adversarial\nattack strategies against DNNs for medical imaging as well as countermeasures.\nIn this study, we review current techniques for adversarial imaging attacks,\ndetections. It also encompasses various facets of these techniques and offers\nsuggestions for the robustness of neural networks to be improved in the future."}

Here, we investigate\nsingle-molecule junctions of the Blatter radical molecule in a mechanically\ncontrolled break junction device at low temperature. Differential conductance\nspectroscopy on individual junctions shows two types of zero-bias anomalies\nattributed to Kondo resonances revealing the ability to retain the open-shell\nnature of the radical molecule in a two-terminal device. Additionally, a high\nnegative magnetoresistance is also observed in junctions without showing a\nzero-bias peak. We posit that the high negative magnetoresistance is due to the\neffect of a singlet-triplet Kondo effect under magnetic field originating from\na double-quantum-dot system consisting of a Blatter radical molecule with a\nstrong correlation to a second side-coupled molecule. Our findings not only\nprovide the possibility of using the Blatter radical in a two-terminal system\nunder cryogenic conditions but also reveal the magnetotransport properties\nemerging from different configurations of the molecule inside a junction."}

A widely considered approach to realize scalable\nMIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules,\neach with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free\nmassive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue\nwith the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the\nbeampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This\nleads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved\non each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented\noptimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems,\nwhich learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by\ntackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps\nwith momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the\noptimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of\niterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation.

A widely considered approach to realize scalable\nMIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules,\neach with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free\nmassive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue\nwith the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the\nbeampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This\nleads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved\non each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented\noptimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems,\nwhich learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by\ntackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps\nwith momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the\noptimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of\niterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation. We show how\npower efficient beamforming can be encouraged by the learned optimizer, via\nboosting architectures with low-resolution phase shifts and with deactivated\nanalog components.

Interestingly, despite the wide range of physical properties\nanalyzed, to date no study has investigated impurity energy levels in 2H-Si.\nHere, we present results of ab initio DFT simulations to describe the effect of\np- and n-type substitutional doping on the structural and electronic properties\nof hexagonal-diamond Si (2H-Si). We first provide a detailed analysis of how a\ngiven impurity can assume a different local symmetry depending on the host\ncrystal phase. Then, by studying neutral and charged dopants, we carefully\nestimate donors and acceptors transition energy levels in 2H-Si and compare\nthem with the cubic-diamond (3C) case. In the case of acceptors, the formation\nenergy is always lower in 2H-Si and is associated with a shallower charge\ntransition level with respect to 3C-Si.

Interestingly, despite the wide range of physical properties\nanalyzed, to date no study has investigated impurity energy levels in 2H-Si.\nHere, we present results of ab initio DFT simulations to describe the effect of\np- and n-type substitutional doping on the structural and electronic properties\nof hexagonal-diamond Si (2H-Si). We first provide a detailed analysis of how a\ngiven impurity can assume a different local symmetry depending on the host\ncrystal phase. Then, by studying neutral and charged dopants, we carefully\nestimate donors and acceptors transition energy levels in 2H-Si and compare\nthem with the cubic-diamond (3C) case. In the case of acceptors, the formation\nenergy is always lower in 2H-Si and is associated with a shallower charge\ntransition level with respect to 3C-Si.

One particularly salient set of features is information content, which\nrequires the samples to be sequences of neighbouring solutions, such that the\nlocal relationships between consecutive sample points are preserved.

It is therefore common to first obtain an unordered sample with\ngood search space coverage, and then apply an ordering algorithm such as the\nnearest neighbour to minimise the distance between consecutive points in the\nsample.

One particularly salient set of features is information content, which\nrequires the samples to be sequences of neighbouring solutions, such that the\nlocal relationships between consecutive sample points are preserved. Generating\nsuch spatially correlated samples that also provide good search space coverage\nis challenging. It is therefore common to first obtain an unordered sample with\ngood search space coverage, and then apply an ordering algorithm such as the\nnearest neighbour to minimise the distance between consecutive points in the\nsample. However, the nearest neighbour algorithm becomes computationally\nprohibitive in higher dimensions, thus there is a need for more efficient\nalternatives. In this study, Hilbert space-filling curves are proposed as a\nmethod to efficiently obtain high-quality ordered samples. Hilbert curves are a\nspecial case of fractal curves, and guarantee uniform coverage of a bounded\nsearch space while providing a spatially correlated sample. We study the\neffectiveness of Hilbert curves as samplers, and discover that they are capable\nof extracting salient features at a fraction of the computational cost compared\nto Latin hypercube sampling with post-factum ordering. Further, we investigate\nthe use of Hilbert curves as an ordering strategy, and find that they order the\nsample significantly faster than the nearest neighbour ordering, without\nsacrificing the saliency of the extracted features."}

This Big Data is valuable within both healthcare and legal\ncontexts, serving as a resource for investigating medical malpractice, civil\ncases, criminal activities, and network-related incidents. However, the rapid\nevolution of network technologies and data creates complexities in digital\nforensics investigations and audits. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a secure decentralised framework aimed at bolstering digital forensics\nreadiness (DFR) in Big Data wireless medical networks by identifying security\nthreats, complexities, and gaps in current research efforts. By improving the\nnetwork's resilience to cyber threats and aiding in medical malpractice\ninvestigations, this framework significantly advances digital forensics,\nwireless networks, and healthcare. It enhances digital forensics readiness,\nincident response, and the management of medical malpractice incidents in Big\nData wireless medical networks. A real-world scenario-based evaluation\ndemonstrated the framework's effectiveness in improving forensic readiness and\nresponse capabilities, validating its practical applicability and impact. A\ncomparison of the proposed framework with existing frameworks concluded that it\nis an advancement in framework design for DFR, especially in regard to Big Data\nprocessing, decentralised DFR storage and scalability."}

We present a measurement of the total inelastic cross section\nof charged kaons on argon as a function of kaon energy using 6 and 7 GeV/$c$\nbeam momentum settings. The flux-weighted average of the extracted inelastic\ncross section at each beam momentum setting was measured to be 380$\\pm$26\nmbarns for the 6 GeV/$c$ setting and 379$\\pm$35 mbarns for the 7 GeV/$c$\nsetting."}

Key to\nthe technique is to replace the search for trade-offs between rate, attribute\nquality and geometry quality, through conditioning the model on the desired\nqualities of both modalities, bypassing the need for training model ensembles.\nTo differentiate important point cloud regions during encoding or to allow\nview-dependent compression for user-centered streaming, conditioning is\npointwise, which allows for local quality and rate variation. Our evaluation\nshows comparable performance to state-of-the-art compression methods for\ngeometry and attributes, while reducing complexity compared to related\ncompression methods."}

This assumption is based on the distinctive characteristics of Co$^{2+}$\nions (3$d^7$) within an octahedral crystal environment, resulting in\nspin-orbit-coupled $J_{\\rm eff}$~=~1/2 doublet states. However, recent\nexperimental observations and theoretical analyses have raised questions\nregarding this hypothesis. Despite these uncertainties, reports of continuum\nexcitations reminiscent of spinon excitations have prompted further\ninvestigations. In this study, we explore the magnetic phases of BCAO under\nboth in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields, employing dc and ac magnetic\nsusceptibilities, capacitance, and torque magnetometry measurement. Our results\naffirm the existence of multiple field-induced magnetic phases, with strong\nanisotropy of the phase boundaries between in-plane and out-of-plane fields. To\nelucidate the nature of these phases, we develop a minimal anisotropic exchange\nmodel. This model, supported by combined first principles calculations and\ntheoretical modeling, quantitatively reproduces our experimental data. In BCAO,\nthe combination of strong bond-independent XXZ anisotropy and geometric\nfrustration leads to significant quantum order by disorder effects that\nstabilize collinear phases under both zero and finite magnetic fields."}

The tool is tailored to capture and analyze the dynamic nature of\nmisinformation spread in digital environments.\n  Results: The effectiveness of DisTrack is demonstrated through three case\nstudies focused on different themes: discredit/hate speech, anti-vaccine\nmisinformation, and false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These\nstudies show DisTrack's capabilities in distinguishing posts that propagate\nfalsehoods from those that counteract them, and tracing the evolution of\nmisinformation from its inception.\n  Conclusions: The research confirms that DisTrack is a valuable tool in the\nfield of misinformation analysis. It effectively distinguishes between\ndifferent types of misinformation and traces their development over time. By\nproviding a comprehensive approach to understanding and combating\nmisinformation in digital spaces, DisTrack proves to be an essential asset for\nresearchers and practitioners working to mitigate the impact of false\ninformation in online social environments."}

This best performance is achieved on N1 data\nusing Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency\ncharacteristics of the EEG signal.

Further to this our pipeline using\nregional signal statistics achieves an accuracy of 78\\%, using brain\nconnectivity only achieves an accuracy of 86\\% whereas combining the two\nachieves a best accuracy of 91\\%. This best performance is achieved on N1 data\nusing Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency\ncharacteristics of the EEG signal. This model also achieves a recall of 80 \\%\nand precision of 96\\%. Furthermore we find that on data from each arousal\nstate, combining PLI with regional signal statistics improves classification\naccuracy versus using signal statistics or brain connectivity alone. Thus we\nconclude that combining brain connectivity statistics with regional EEG\nstatistics is optimal for classifier performance on early stage Parkinson's.\nAdditionally, we find outperformance of N1 EEG for classification of\nParkinson's and expect this could be due to disrupted N1 sleep in PD. This\nshould be explored in future work."}

We study inference scaling laws (aka test-time scaling laws) and\ncompute-optimal inference, focusing on the trade-offs between model sizes and\ngenerating additional tokens with different inference strategies. As a first\nstep towards understanding and designing compute-optimal inference methods, we\nstudied cost-performance trade-offs for inference strategies such as greedy\nsearch, majority voting, best-of-$n$, weighted voting, and two different tree\nsearch algorithms, using different model sizes and compute budgets. Our\nfindings suggest that scaling inference compute with inference strategies can\nbe more computationally efficient than scaling model parameters.

We study inference scaling laws (aka test-time scaling laws) and\ncompute-optimal inference, focusing on the trade-offs between model sizes and\ngenerating additional tokens with different inference strategies. As a first\nstep towards understanding and designing compute-optimal inference methods, we\nstudied cost-performance trade-offs for inference strategies such as greedy\nsearch, majority voting, best-of-$n$, weighted voting, and two different tree\nsearch algorithms, using different model sizes and compute budgets.

Semantic communication (SemCom) provides a solution\nfor extracting information meanings from the transmitted content. The semantic\ninformation can be successfully interpreted by a receiver with the help of a\nshared knowledge base (KB). This paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical\nqualification and validation model for natural language-based\nmachine-to-machine (M2M) SemCom. The approach can be applied in various\napplications, such as autonomous driving and edge computing. In the proposed\nmodel, we quantitatively measure the degree of understanding (DoU) between two\ncommunication parties at the word and sentence levels. The DoU is validated and\nensured at each level before moving to the next step. The model's effectiveness\nis verified through a series of experiments, and the results show that the\nquantification and validation method proposed in this paper can significantly\nimprove the DoU of inter-machine SemCom."}

Most\ninterestingly, our results show that contact-conditioned policies generalize\nmuch better than other common goal representations in the literature, when the\nrobot is tested outside the distribution of the training data."}

We investigate the parameterized complexity of\nthe problem for the parameter twin cover and the combined parameter distance to\ncluster, membership($k$) and prove that the problem is fixed-parameter\ntractable. Using a dynamic programming based approach, we obtain a linear-time\nalgorithm for trees."}

This is\nachieved by coupling off-the-shelf mmWave radar and depth camera technology\nwith a novel neural network architecture that processes the radar signals using\nconvolutional Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) blocks and the depth signal, using\nconvolutional operations. The combined latent features are then magnified using\na deep feature magnification to learn cross-modality dependencies in the data.\nWe further propose a decoder, based on the feature extraction and embedding\nblock, to learn an efficient upsampling of the latent space to learn the\nlocation of the concealed object in the spatial domain through radar feature\nguidance. We demonstrate the detection of presence and inference of 3D location\nof concealed metal objects with an accuracy of up to 95%, using a technique\nthat is robust to multiple persons.

However, the\ncanonical FDM model with a mass of $10^{-22}~{\\rm eV}$ encounters challenges in\nreproducing the observed diversity of dwarf galaxies, except for possibly\nscenarios where strong galactic feedback is invoked. The introduction of\nmultiple-field FDM can provide a potential resolution to this diversity issue.\nThe theoretical plausibility of this dark matter model is also enhanced by the\nfact that multiple axion species with logarithmically-distributed mass spectrum\nexist as a generic prediction of string theory. In this paper we consider the\naxiverse hypothesis and investigate non-linear structure formation in the\ntwo-field fuzzy dark matter (2FDM) model. Our cosmological simulation with an\nunprecedented resolution and self-consistent initial conditions reveals the\ndiverse structures of dark matter haloes in the 2FDM model for the first time.\nDepending on the formation time and local tidal activities, late-time haloes\ncan host solitons of nested cores or solitons of one dominant species."}

Firstly, morphological\nstructures within the galaxy cluster were examined using a Gaussian Gradient\nMagnitude (GGM) and adaptively smoothed GGM filter applied to the EPIC-pn X-ray\nimage. Then, we applied a novel {\\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn energy scale\ncalibration, which uses instrumental Cu K$\\alpha$ as reference for the line\nemission, to measure line-of-sight velocities of the hot gas within the system.\nThis approach enabled us to create two-dimensional projected maps for velocity,\ntemperature, and metallicity, showing that the hot gas displays a redshifted\nsystemic velocity relative to the cluster redshift across all fields of view.\nFurther analysis of the velocity distribution through non-overlapping circular\nregions demonstrated consistent redshifted velocities extending up to 1125 kpc\nfrom the cluster core. Additionally, the velocity distribution was assessed\nalong regions following surface brightness discontinuities, where we observed\nredshifted velocities in all regions, with the largest velocities reaching $768\n\\pm 284$ km/s. Moreover, we computed the velocity Probability Density Function\n(PDF) from the velocity map. We applied a normality test, finding that the PDF\nadheres to an unimodal normal distribution consistent with theoretical\npredictions. Lastly, we computed a velocity structure function (VSF) for this\nsystem using the measured line-of-sight velocities. These insights advance our\nunderstanding of the dynamic processes within the A3266 galaxy cluster and\ncontribute to our broader knowledge of ICM behavior in merging galaxy clusters."}

Firstly, morphological\nstructures within the galaxy cluster were examined using a Gaussian Gradient\nMagnitude (GGM) and adaptively smoothed GGM filter applied to the EPIC-pn X-ray\nimage. Then, we applied a novel {\\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn energy scale\ncalibration, which uses instrumental Cu K$\\alpha$ as reference for the line\nemission, to measure line-of-sight velocities of the hot gas within the system.\nThis approach enabled us to create two-dimensional projected maps for velocity,\ntemperature, and metallicity, showing that the hot gas displays a redshifted\nsystemic velocity relative to the cluster redshift across all fields of view.\nFurther analysis of the velocity distribution through non-overlapping circular\nregions demonstrated consistent redshifted velocities extending up to 1125 kpc\nfrom the cluster core. Additionally, the velocity distribution was assessed\nalong regions following surface brightness discontinuities, where we observed\nredshifted velocities in all regions, with the largest velocities reaching $768\n\\pm 284$ km/s. Moreover, we computed the velocity Probability Density Function\n(PDF) from the velocity map. We applied a normality test, finding that the PDF\nadheres to an unimodal normal distribution consistent with theoretical\npredictions. Lastly, we computed a velocity structure function (VSF) for this\nsystem using the measured line-of-sight velocities. These insights advance our\nunderstanding of the dynamic processes within the A3266 galaxy cluster and\ncontribute to our broader knowledge of ICM behavior in merging galaxy clusters."}

This system was\ndiscovered as a spatial overdensity of resolved stars observed with Dark Energy\nCamera (DECam) data from an early version of the third data release of the\nDECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE EDR3). The low luminosity ($M_V =\n-3.56_{-0.37}^{+0.47}$ ; $L_V = 2300_{-700}^{+1200} L_\\odot$), large size\n($R_{1/2} = 90_{-30}^{+30}$ pc), and large heliocentric distance ($D =\n111_{-6}^{+9}$ kpc) are all consistent with the population of ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies (UFDs). Using Keck/DEIMOS observations of the system, we were able to\nspectroscopically confirm nine member stars, while measuring a tentative\nmass-to-light ratio of $700_{-500}^{+1400} M_\\odot/L_\\odot$ and a non-zero\nmetallicity dispersion of $\\sigma_{[\\rm Fe/H]}=0.19_{-0.11}^{+0.14}$, further\nconfirming Leo VI's identity as an UFD. While the system has a highly\nelliptical shape, $\\epsilon = 0.54_{-0.29}^{+0.19}$, we do not find any\nconclusive evidence that it is tidally disrupting.

Discovery of the Leo VI Milky Way Satellite Galaxy with DELVE Early Data Release 3", "summary": "We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-faint\nMilky Way (MW) satellite in the constellation of Leo. This system was\ndiscovered as a spatial overdensity of resolved stars observed with Dark Energy\nCamera (DECam) data from an early version of the third data release of the\nDECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE EDR3). The low luminosity ($M_V =\n-3.56_{-0.37}^{+0.47}$ ; $L_V = 2300_{-700}^{+1200} L_\\odot$), large size\n($R_{1/2} = 90_{-30}^{+30}$ pc), and large heliocentric distance ($D =\n111_{-6}^{+9}$ kpc) are all consistent with the population of ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies (UFDs). Using Keck/DEIMOS observations of the system, we were able to\nspectroscopically confirm nine member stars, while measuring a tentative\nmass-to-light ratio of $700_{-500}^{+1400} M_\\odot/L_\\odot$ and a non-zero\nmetallicity dispersion of $\\sigma_{[\\rm Fe/H]}=0.19_{-0.11}^{+0.14}$, further\nconfirming Leo VI's identity as an UFD. While the system has a highly\nelliptical shape, $\\epsilon = 0.54_{-0.29}^{+0.19}$, we do not find any\nconclusive evidence that it is tidally disrupting.

What is the intent is to\nshow how exact results from Maxwell's equations explain why fast reconnection\nis so ubiquitous and what constraints these results place on the theory of\nmagnetic field evolution, including dynamos, whether the plasma is turbulent or\nnot. These constraints are commonly broken in the reconnection literature,\nwhich has been heavily influenced by two-dimensional theory that is not\napplicable to three-dimensional problems."}

Double-detonations arise when a surface\nhelium shell detonation generates shockwaves that trigger a core detonation;\nthis mechanism may be triggered via accretion or during the merger of binaries.\nMost previous double-detonation simulations only included the primary white\ndwarf; however, the fate of the secondary has significant observational\nconsequences. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations accounted for the companion in\ndouble-degenerate double-detonation mergers. In the merger of a\n1.05$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ primary white dwarf and 0.7$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ secondary\nwhite dwarf, the primary consistently detonates while the fate of the secondary\nremains uncertain. We consider two versions of this scenario, one in which the\nsecondary survives and another in which it detonates. We present the first 3D\nradiative transfer calculations for these models and show that the synthetic\nobservables for both models are similar and match properties of the peculiar\n02es-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Our calculations show angle\ndependencies sensitive to the companion's fate, and we can obtain a closer\nspectroscopic match to normal Type Ia supernovae when the secondary detonates\nand the effects of helium detonation ash are minimised. The asymmetry in the\nwidth-luminosity relationship is comparable to previous double-detonation\nmodels, but the overall spread is increased with a secondary detonation.

Double-detonations arise when a surface\nhelium shell detonation generates shockwaves that trigger a core detonation;\nthis mechanism may be triggered via accretion or during the merger of binaries.\nMost previous double-detonation simulations only included the primary white\ndwarf; however, the fate of the secondary has significant observational\nconsequences. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations accounted for the companion in\ndouble-degenerate double-detonation mergers. In the merger of a\n1.05$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ primary white dwarf and 0.7$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ secondary\nwhite dwarf, the primary consistently detonates while the fate of the secondary\nremains uncertain. We consider two versions of this scenario, one in which the\nsecondary survives and another in which it detonates. We present the first 3D\nradiative transfer calculations for these models and show that the synthetic\nobservables for both models are similar and match properties of the peculiar\n02es-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Our calculations show angle\ndependencies sensitive to the companion's fate, and we can obtain a closer\nspectroscopic match to normal Type Ia supernovae when the secondary detonates\nand the effects of helium detonation ash are minimised. The asymmetry in the\nwidth-luminosity relationship is comparable to previous double-detonation\nmodels, but the overall spread is increased with a secondary detonation. The\nsecondary detonation has a meaningful impact on all synthetic observables;\nhowever, multidimensional nebular phase calculations are needed to support or\nrule out either model as a likely explanation for Type Ia supernovae."}

Our results\ndemonstrate PERSOMA's superior ability to handle large and complex user\nhistories compared to existing embedding-based and text-prompt-based\ntechniques."}

It suggests that these two types of echoes\nderive from different physical origins and can be independently triggered. The\noccurrence and interplay between these two types of echoes are demonstrated\nthrough numerical simulations. %The observational relevance of this study is\nalso addressed."}

Due to the unavailability of\ndatasets that provide microscopic traffic details and traffic incident details\nsimultaneously, we also present a methodology to generate a synthetic\nmicroscopic traffic dataset that matches given macroscopic traffic data.\nIncidentNet achieves a traffic incident detection rate of 98%, with false alarm\nrates of less than 7% in 197 seconds on average in urban environments with\ncameras on less than 20% of the traffic intersections."}

For each task, we thoroughly examine and present in a tabular\nformat the central physics-guided operation, the region of interest (with\nrespect to human anatomy), the corresponding imaging modality, the dataset used\nfor model training, the deep network architecture employed, and the primary\nphysical process, equation, or principle utilized. Additionally, we also\nintroduce a novel metric to compare the performance of PIMIA methods across\ndifferent tasks and datasets. Based on this review, we summarize and distil our\nperspectives on the challenges, open research questions, and directions for\nfuture research. We highlight key open challenges in PIMIA, including selecting\nsuitable physics priors and establishing a standardized benchmarking platform."}

However, pinpointing host galaxies\nremains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly\nfading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of\nshort gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our\nunderstanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily\nmerge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of\n76 sGRBs and 4 hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like\nsignals. We use this data to evaluate their physical properties through\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.

However, pinpointing host galaxies\nremains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly\nfading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of\nshort gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our\nunderstanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily\nmerge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of\n76 sGRBs and 4 hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like\nsignals.

Tools such as impact\nassessments have gained prominence as a method to uncover potential impacts,\nand a number of publication venues now encourage authors to include an impact\nstatement in their submissions. Despite this push, little is known about the\nway researchers assess, articulate, and address the potential negative societal\nimpact of their work -- especially in industry settings, where research\noutcomes are often quickly integrated into products. In addition, while there\nare nascent efforts to support researchers in this task, there remains a dearth\nof empirically-informed tools and processes. Through interviews with 25\nindustry computing researchers across different companies and research areas,\nwe first identify four key factors that influence how they grapple with (or\nchoose not to grapple with) the societal impact of their research. To develop\nan effective impact assessment template tailored to industry computing\nresearchers' needs, we conduct an iterative co-design process with these 25\nindustry researchers and an additional 16 researchers and practitioners with\nprior experience and expertise in reviewing and developing impact assessments\nor broad responsible computing practices. Through the co-design process, we\ndevelop 10 design considerations to facilitate the effective design,\ndevelopment, and adaptation of an impact assessment template for use in\nindustry research settings and beyond, as well as our own ``Societal Impact\nAssessment'' template with concrete scaffolds.

Tools such as impact\nassessments have gained prominence as a method to uncover potential impacts,\nand a number of publication venues now encourage authors to include an impact\nstatement in their submissions. Despite this push, little is known about the\nway researchers assess, articulate, and address the potential negative societal\nimpact of their work -- especially in industry settings, where research\noutcomes are often quickly integrated into products. In addition, while there\nare nascent efforts to support researchers in this task, there remains a dearth\nof empirically-informed tools and processes. Through interviews with 25\nindustry computing researchers across different companies and research areas,\nwe first identify four key factors that influence how they grapple with (or\nchoose not to grapple with) the societal impact of their research. To develop\nan effective impact assessment template tailored to industry computing\nresearchers' needs, we conduct an iterative co-design process with these 25\nindustry researchers and an additional 16 researchers and practitioners with\nprior experience and expertise in reviewing and developing impact assessments\nor broad responsible computing practices. Through the co-design process, we\ndevelop 10 design considerations to facilitate the effective design,\ndevelopment, and adaptation of an impact assessment template for use in\nindustry research settings and beyond, as well as our own ``Societal Impact\nAssessment'' template with concrete scaffolds. We explore the effectiveness of\nthis template through a user study with 15 industry research interns, revealing\nboth its strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the implications for\nfuture researchers and organizations seeking to foster more responsible\nresearch practices."}

This famous conjecture has inspired various connections with different\nbranches of physics, recently with non-Hermitian physics, quantum field theory,\ntrapped-ion qubits, and hyperuniformity. Here we develop the computing platform\nfor the Riemann zeta function by employing classical scattering of light. We\nshow that the Riemann hypothesis suggests the landscape of semi-infinite\noptical scatterers for the perfect reflectionless condition under the Born\napproximation. To examine the validity of the scattering-based computation, we\ninvestigate the asymptotic behaviours of suppressed reflections with the\nincreasing number of scatterers and the emergence of multiple scattering. The\nresult provides another bridge between classical physics and the Riemann zeros,\nexhibiting the design of wave devices inspired by number theory."}
